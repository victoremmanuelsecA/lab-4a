        <h2>About me</h2>



<p>
    My journey to Humber was my first time travelling without my parents and without my friends. It was my first time away from home.

When I was in school I kept telling people that one day I would study abroad. But I didn’t have any specific place in mind. My parents are getting older, my brother had already come to Canada and I didn’t think I could find the money. I don’t know if it was luck but one day my brother told me ‘OK, I will take care of the money. Just come here.You need to come.’

I couldn’t see much of a career path in India. I have a Masters Degree in Sports Nutrition and I was having trouble finding a job. So I thought, let's take a bit of a plunge and see what happens. I was searching for the 10 best colleges in Toronto and Humber kept coming up. I thought to myself, this has to mean something.
